    "text": "The SPARK Method\nThis guide aims to help you make the most of reading review articles in psychology or summarizing an academic podcast.\nAcknowledgement: I used ChatGPT to build this section:\n\nOpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (May 24 version) [Large language model]. https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\nReview articles provide a broader understanding of a topic by integrating and summarizing existing research. Whether you’re studying psychology in a seminar course, exploring the field in a research context, or out of personal interest, this guide will help you read and engage with review articles effectively.\nAcademic podcasts seek to provide an informative, thought-provoking, and comprehensive exploration of a chosen topic. They offer a platform for in-depth conversations, where academic expertise converges with real-world applications, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of the subject matter among the listeners.\n\nFinding a paper or podcast\nThe first step is to find a review article to read or a podcast to listen to. To demonstrate SPARK, we will choose the following review article:\n\nCarpenter, S. K., Pan, S. C., & Butler, A. C. (2022). The science of effective learning with spacing and retrieval practice. Nature Reviews Psychology, 1(9), 496-511.\n\nThis paper was published in the journal Nature Reviews Psychology in 2022 and can be freely downloaded as a pdf here.\nBefore continuing, please download the paper and peruse through it briefly. As you might have noticed, review articles tend to be longer than primary research articles, as they summarize several different strands of research.\nWe will also use the following podcast as an example:\n\nDeepMind Podcast: AI and neuroscience: The virtuous circle\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a review article\nReview articles typically follow some kind of structure:\n\nIntroduction: Sets the stage, explains the relevance of the topic, and outlines the objectives of the review.\nHistorical context or background: Provides a historical perspective or background information on the topic to offer context.\nThemes or subtopics covered: Organizes the content into themes or subtopics, giving you an overview of the field.\nSummary of key findings: Presents the main conclusions and key findings from the reviewed literature. Often, these findings are presented for each theme or subtopic.\nConclusion and future directions: Interim conclusions/future directions summarize the main points for each theme/subtopic and suggest avenues for future research. Broader conclusions/future directions are often at the very end of the review article, that try to bring together common ideas across themes/subtopics.\nReferences: Provides a list of sources for further exploration.\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a Podcast\nPodcasts come in several formats, but for an academic podcast, here’s a more detailed outline:\n\nHost(s) and speaker(s): Engaging hosts and knowledgeable speakers guide the conversation, providing expertise and facilitating a dynamic discussion.\nBroader questions and ideas: Each episode centers around a thought-provoking and overarching question or idea, fostering critical thinking and exploration of diverse perspectives.\nSpecific studies/findings: The podcast delves into specific studies, research findings, and scholarly work relevant to the topic, providing evidence-based insights and analysis.\nConnections and implications: The discussions draw connections between the research and its broader implications, highlighting real-world applications, potential impacts, and avenues for further exploration.\n\n\n\nWhat does SPARK stand for?\nSPARK stands for Subject, Perspectives, Analysis, Reflection, and Knowledge. Let’s explore each subpoint in more detail:\n\nS stands for Subject\nThe subject refers to the main topic being discussed in the review article or podcast. It represents the central theme or subject matter that the article or podcast aims to address. It is important to understand the significance of the chosen topic within the field of psychology. What makes it relevant, timely, or impactful? Consider how the subject contributes to existing knowledge, addresses gaps, or brings new insights to the field.\n\n\nP stands for Perspectives\nThis subpoint involves identifying the main themes or subtopics covered in the review article or podcast. Look for the different perspectives, viewpoints, or angles explored by the author(s) regarding the chosen subject. These perspectives can provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic by considering diverse viewpoints, theoretical frameworks, or empirical evidence. Consider the range of perspectives presented and how they contribute to the overall understanding of the subject.\n\n\nA stands for Analysis\nIn this stage, focus on the key findings summarized for each subtopic or theme discussed in the review article or podcast. Explore how the author(s) evaluated the evidence and drew conclusions. Consider the research studies, theories, or empirical data presented to support the key findings. Evaluate the strength of the evidence and the quality of the analysis provided. Reflect on what is currently known about the topic based on the presented evidence.\n\n\nR stands for Reflection\nThis subpoint requires examining any limitations or gaps in the reviewed literature that the authors mentioned. Consider the authors’ reflections on the existing knowledge or potential biases in the research studies reviewed. Additionally, pay attention to any suggestions made by the authors for future research directions. Reflect on the implications of the identified limitations or gaps and how they contribute to the understanding of the subject. Consider the potential areas for further investigation or improvement in the field.\n\n\nK stands for Knowledge\nThink about how reading the review article or listening to the podcast has influenced your own perspectives or raised new questions about the topic. This is also a place to reflect on the class discussion we had in a given week. Identify the key insights or findings you gained from this week’s discussion. Consider how these insights contribute to your overall understanding of the subject. Reflect on any new knowledge acquired and its potential impact on your future thinking, research, or practice within the field of psychology.\nBy following the SPARK framework, you can engage in a comprehensive analysis of a review article or podcast, extracting key information, evaluating the evidence, and gaining a deeper understanding of the chosen subject matter in the field of psychology.\n\n\n\nWriting a SPARK summary\nWriting a SPARK summary involves answering a set of questions:\n\nSubject: What is the main topic of the review article/podcast, and why is it significant in the field of psychology?\nPerspectives: What ideas or subthemes have been considered or presented?\nAnalysis: What key findings were summarized for each subtopic/theme, and how did the author(s) evaluate the evidence? What do we know so far?\nReflection: What limitations or gaps in the reviewed literature do you see or the authors highlight? What potential areas of future research do they suggest?\nKnowledge: What key insights or findings did you gain from reading the review article or listening to the podcast and the class discussion? How do these insights contribute to your understanding of the topic?\n\n\n\nExample SPARK: Review Article\nThe review article we have chosen is titled “The science of effective learning with spacing and retrieval practice.”. Below is an example SPARK summary for the article:\nArticle: Carpenter, S. K., Pan, S. C., & Butler, A. C. (2022). The science of effective learning with spacing and retrieval practice. Nature Reviews Psychology, 1(9), 496-511.\n\nNote: The APA citation is the first thing your SPARK summary should contain. This informs the reader (usually me) which article you have chosen to summarize.\n\nSubject: In the review article, the subject is effective learning, i.e., how can we be effective learners? This topic is significant because humans learn new skills and knowledge throughout their lifetime, and this knowledge helps them navigate the world around them. Therefore, knowing how to learn effectively is important - especially early in life when humans are being exposed to a large amount of new information.\nPerspectives: The review focuses on two main learning strategies: spacing and retrieval practice. Spacing is the strategy of spacing out the learning of material, and retrieval practice involves repeatedly engaging in active retrieval of the material. The review also discusses the research on metacognition and how it may contribute to the adoption and effectiveness of these strategies in real-world contexts. The research on metacognition in cognitive psychology and education is discussed.\nAnalysis:\n\nNote: This piece is likely going to be the longest part of your SPARK summary.\nThe article first discusses the research on spacing. The authors summarize a large collection of research (Table 1) across many age groups (preschool to older adults), learning materials (words, pictures, courses, etc.), and spacing implementations (how spaced does learning need to be? 30 seconds to 1-2 weeks). The broader consensus is that spacing works. There is no clear sense of what the ideal spacing schedule looks like but 1 to 7 days is a generally good ballpark. The recommendation from the authors is that the material should feel “still familiar but not fresh in the mind”. They also briefly touch on why spacing works. There are many theories, such as spacing creates “distinct learning experiences” which serve as memory cues, or that it provides a “mental break”, or that it encourages retrieval practice by forcing people to retrieve from the earlier session.\nThe article then discusses the research on retrieval practice. As before, the authors summarize many years of research (table 2) across age groups, materials, and implementation (what kind of retrieval practice? multiple-choice, true-false, cued recall, short answer, etc.), with the consensus that it works. They also emphasize how feedback is important for retrieval practice as it can help identify gaps in knowledge. They also discuss why retrieval practice works: by providing additional cues/routes to the same information and likely some neural consolidation mechanisms. Finally, they discuss that while retrieval practice is very robust for near transfer (to very similar problems/tasks), the research on far transfer is less robust.\nFinally, the authors discuss metacognition: the ability to think about one’s thinking and regulate one’s actions accordingly. They talk about how the cognitive psychology research has focused on micro-level constructs: awareness/monitoring and regulation/control. The research seems to suggest that learners are bad at both. The educational psychology research has focused on macro-level constructs: planning, goals, evaluation, motivation, and affect. This work seems to suggest that learners’ motivation is critical and may play into both awareness and regulation and thus complements the cognitive research.\n\nReflection: The authors discuss how the successful relearning could happen by combining the benefits of spacing and retrieval practice. However, they also emphasize that improving metacognition is key to successful relearning, but is also very difficult. Research suggests that simply making students aware, or giving them experience with the strategies is not sufficient. They discuss false beliefs about learning may be key here: students and teachers both may not know what strategies are effective and may believe that strategies that need more effort or time may not be as effective, contrary to what the evidence suggests. They suggest that a comprehensive framework that emphasizes knowledge, belief, commitment, and planning may be required to improve metacognition. They also discuss how it is important to truly understand learner’s perspectives in future research, as well how technology may change how stategies are implemented and adopted in the future.\nKnowledge:\n\nNote: This is where you would consolidate all the information you learned from the paper AND the class discussion.\nPersonally, I found the paper really interesting and succinct in describing the current research on effective learning strategies. When I was an undergraduate, I had very little information about what strategies worked and didn’t, and was often left to guess how I should apprach my learning. I was good in some courses and not so good at others, and it was very unclear if it was my learning style, my motivation, or the environment. Knowing what I know now would have been really helpful! I would have liked to know a bit more about interventions that target motivational or affective aspects of metacognition.\n\n\n\nExample SPARK: Podcast\nThe podcast we have chosen is titled “AI and neuroscience: The virtuous circle”. Below is an example SPARK summary for the podcast:\nPodcast: DeepMind Podcast: AI and neuroscience: The virtuous circle\n\nNote: The citation is the first thing your SPARK summary should contain. This informs the reader (usually me) which article/podcast you have chosen to summarize.\n\nSubject: The podcast discusses the goals of artificial intelligence, what it means for a machine to be intelligent, and how closely should it mimic human/animal minds. These ideas/questions are important as we are living in a world where artificial systems are all around us, and so understanding the motivations of the researchers behind these tools is important, just as important as figuring out exactly how AI learns from or builds on neuroscience.\nPerspectives: Hannah Fry (the host) talks to Demis Hassabis the founder of DeepMind, as well as other scientists in the podcasts, such as Jess Hamrick, Matt Botvinick, Greg Wayne. They first discuss what the goals and potential of AI is: what can AI achieve and what should we want it to achieve? They next discuss how AI has learned from and can learn from human and animal minds. They talk about the idea of Moravec’s paradox: where the seemingly simple things humans do turn out to be the most complex things to program in an AI. Finally, they discuss how AI has also informed and advanced neuroscience.\nAnalysis:\n\nGoals: Demis believes that AI could be used to solve humanity’s biggest problems, such as climate change, cancer, language, energy, etc. But to achieve all this, we need to decide what kind of AI do we want to build - should it be like a human or completely different? Hamrick weighs in on this and says that it is important for AI to be a little bit like us because if AI systems are deployed in the real world and they are not like us, or don’t think like us, then there will be no trust in them and this lack of understanding what it’s doing will make its use problematic. Fry discusses the case of an AI trained to diagnose skin cancer using images, where the AI was making judgments based on random information (a ruler in the photos). Botvinick discusses how AI needs to definitely “think like a human” in some ways but may need to go beyond that. They discuss the Wright brothers and how the idea originated from observing birds for years but then moving a step ahead to make planes.\nNeuroscience inspiration: Fry discusses the idea of replay in human and animal brains, where past experiences are replayed over and over, which has been recast into reinforcement learning in AI, where the program remembers and learns from previous plays to inform future plays in games. Hamrick discusses the idea of mental simulation and how it helps us make predictions about the world, something that AI systems are also using now. Wayne discusses animal research on scrub jays and their ability to remember information about where they have stored their food on very long time scales.\nReward: Fry describes how AI systems learn in the first place: not through rules, but through keeping track of 0s and 1s and learning through prediction, i.e., by predicting when a reward might occur, the system learns a particular behavior.\nMoravec’s paradox: Fry discusses the overarching theme that emerges from these discussions: that tasks that are seemingly simple for humans such as sitting, picking things up, etc. are the ones that are very hard to teach machines. But with advances in neuroscience and AI, Hassabis thinks this no longer needs to be a barrier as we have begun to understand how vision works through pattern recognition, etc.\nAI back to neuroscience: Botvinick discusses the research on dopamine, where they were trying to understand why dopamine is released in the brain. The brain research came across computer scientists who were working on reinforcement learning, which led to a revolution in neuroscience: dopamine wasn’t the response to the reward, but it was the prediction error (what was the expectation vs. what was received).\n\nReflection: Overall, this podcast introduced a lot of exciting themes and questions. The host reflected on the history of the field in tandem with developments in neuroscience and where the current research is heading in AI. There appear to be many different motives and ideas in the field.\nKnowledge:\n\nNote: This is where you would consolidate all the information you learned from the paper AND the class discussion.\nI found the podcast interesting and learned quite a bit! As a cognitive scientist, it was interesting for me to learn some of the early connections between neuroscience and AI, and how it truly is a circle. I am curious to know more about how different cognitive aspects of the human/animal mind may be essential vs. exciting to implement in artificial systems."

Students learn about experimental and computational/mathematical methods of understanding cognition and building real-world tools and applications, and also dive into classic and contemporary research on several aspects of the human mind, such as memory, language, and social cognition through short lectures, podcasts, active discussions, and in-class activities.\n\n\n\nAt the end of this course, I hope that you will:  1. Understand the fundamental questions & prominent methodologies in the study of cognition [Department Goals #1 and #4]  2. Connect theoretical ideas about cognition to specific evidence across different sub-domains and real-world applications [Department Goal #2]  3. Reflect on the sociocultural issues surrounding the study of cognition [Department Goal #3] \n\n\n\nWe are not using a textbook for this course. All of the course materials will be available in a timely fashion on this course website and/or posted on Canvas.\n\n\n\nThere are 16 total weeks in this course. Weekly learning modules will cover different topics in cognitive psychology. Assessment weeks are interspersed across the semester. Students are expected to complete the learning modules and assessments which provide opportunities to earn up to 100 points (+3 extra credit) toward a final grade.\nThis is an in-person class, and students are expected to attend all class sessions.\n\n\n\nWeekly learning modules include three components to encourage engagement with cognitive science in different ways.\nPREP: Most modules either have an assigned reading or surveys/experiments. All material is freely available and posted on Canvas or the course website. Student are expected to complete the assigned material before classes where the material is discussed. This will count towards class participation.\nTRY: We will actively learn about different cognitive domains in class via lectures, group work, and activities. This component will involve you actively participating in class.\nAPPLY: At the end of each week, you will also have a quiz and/or project milestones due. These assignments will help you build on the skills you learn in class, retain information, and apply them to actual tasks and problems you may encounter in psychological research."

Students are encouraged to choose the assignments that work best for them. Course assessments that occur throughout the semester are designed to help students set and achieve their own goals for engaging in course content.\n\nPoints\n\n\n\nComponent\nTotal\nLearning goal\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly quizzes\n25\nUnderstand, Connect, Reflect\n\n\n\nMidterm exam\n20\nUnderstand, Connect\n\n\n\nFinal exam\n30\nUnderstand, Connect\n\n\n\nProject work\n15\nConnect, Reflect\n\n\n\nClass participation\n10\nConnect, Reflect\n\n\n\nExtra credit\n5\nReflect\n\n\n\nTotal\n105\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly quizzes\nEach week, you will complete a quiz that will cover the content covered in class. Quizzes will be posted on Canvas and will contain 5-10 multiple-choice and/or true/false questions. You will be allowed two attempts on each quiz and your average score will be recorded. Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to attempt the quiz after carefully reviewing the material.\nPlease note that all assignments must be submitted before the due date each week (details on Canvas) to count towards the final grade - late submissions will NOT be accepted (unless you are using a flex day, see late work policy).\nEach quiz will be worth 5 points on Canvas but scores will be ultimately scaled to total to 25% of your final score in the course.\n\n\nAssessments\nThere are two assessments throughout the semester: the midterm (March 6) and the final (during finals week). The purpose of these assessments is to provide you with feedback on your general engagement and retention of information during the course.\nPlease note that both assessments will be cumulative, i.e., these assessments will be based on the course content covered up until the previous class and will involve multiple-choice, true/false and/or short-answer questions.\nAssessments will be conducted in-person.\n\n\nProject work\nThe course focuses on understanding empirical research in cognitive science. To help you improve your critical analysis skills, and foster increased intellectual engagement with topics in cognitive science, you will have the opportunity to create a group project that discusses the real-life implications of any topic we cover in class. As a group, you will review some empirical articles on a topic of your choosing, prepare an argument, and present your findings to the class via a project presentation.\nYou are encouraged to reach out to me or the LA to chat about potential options you are considering for your project during office hours.\nOverall, your project will be worth 15% of your grade and will be spread across a few formative milestones. The breakdown of how the milestones contribute to your final project grade is below:\n\n\n\nMilestone\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nQuestions of interest\n2\n\n\nSPARK for review article\n3\n\n\nEmpirical article list + summary\n5\n\n\nFinal presentation\n5\n\n\nTotal\n15\n\n\n\n\nMilestone 1: Questions of Interest (2 points)\nThis assessment will happen relatively early in the semester to gauge which topic(s) you may be interested in exploring through the project. Your questions must be relevant to cognition. We will use this assessment to form interest-based groups for the rest of the semester.\n\n\nMilestone 2: SPARK for review article or podcast (3 points)\nThis assessment will help you organize your literature review and structure your analysis and/or writing/designing. With your group, you will find a review article or podcast relevant to your project and submit a SPARK summary of the article or podcast. Review articles and podcasts typically summarize the existing literature on a particular topic. This will help you understand the topic you are interested in detail, and enable you to ultimately connect ideas across readings.\nPicking a review article: You must find and read a broad review article from one of the journals listed on the course website and then submit a SPARK summary for the same.\nPicking a podcast: You must find and listen to a podcast from one of the following sources and then submit a SPARK summary for the same:\n\nSpeaking of Psychology\nAll Things Cognition\nUnder the Cortex\nMany Minds\nScience Vs\nComplexity\nHidden Brain\n\n\n\nMilestone 3: Argument (5 points)\nIn this milestone, you will find at least 2 empirical articles on your chosen topic (each representing a central argument, think pros and cons). Empirical articles typically describe an experiment or a collection of experiments that attempt to answer a research question. You have wide latitude in selecting the articles you choose to summarize, as long as they are published in an appropriate journal (peer-reviewed, research reports, and theoretical reports) and not in a popular magazine or on the internet. You can locate your article through a Google Scholar, PsycInfo, or PsycArticles search. The course website has a list of good cognitive science journals you can refer to for this assignment. You might want to use your podcast or review article as a starting point to search for these articles.\nYou might want to try different keywords and look for highly cited articles and recent articles about the topic and read the abstracts. Finally, having perused about ~5-10 articles, you might want to select ones that you find most interesting and informative. After finding these articles, you should compile a list of references as well as collaboratively write up an argument that discusses both sides of the argument, using your sources (the review article/podcast + the empirical articles + any other sources you may want to add). You should ultimately work towards a logical argument based on the evidence you have accumulated.\n\n\nMilestone 4: Final presentation (5 points)\nFor this milestone, you will present your project work at the end of the semester.\n\n\n\nClass participation\nThere are several ways for you to actively engage with the course. You are strongly encouraged to contribute to class discussions, talk with your peers, ask and answer questions, and push yourself. Beyond in-class engagement (which could earn you extra credit!), here are other ways in which your class participation will be assessed:\n\nCompleting activities (5 points): To encourage you to critically engage with the class content, there will be class activities that you may be asked to complete before you come to class. These class activities are intended to spark curiosity for the content we’ll cover in the upcoming class and also give you a feel for the experimental nature of cognitive science. You will get full credit if you participate in at least 90% of the class participation activities and exercises. Beyond that, you will be assigned partial credit based on the number of activities/exercises you miss, i.e., 1 point will be deducted for each 10% drop in participation (e.g., if you participate in 80% of the activities, you will earn 4 points out of 5, if you attend 70% of the classes, you will earn 3 points out of 5, etc.).\nCompleting practice exam(s) (5 points): Before each exam, a practice exam will be made available to you to help with your preparation. Submitting these practice exams and getting at least 50% on them will count towards class participation. Completing each practice exam is worth 2.5 points.\n\n\n\nExtra credit\nThere will be some opportunities to earn extra credit during the semester. These opportunities are described below:\n\nComplete class surveys (2 points) : There will be 3 surveys during the semester to gather your reflections and suggestions to improve the course. You will be able to earn 1 point for completing the first survey, and 0.5 for the other two surveys. With the exception of the pre-class survey, the two other surveys will be anonymous.\n Win Cognitive Curator (1-2 points): To incentivize timely preparation and encourage you to master the class content, you will have the opportunity to submit multiple-choice and/or true/false questions based on the course content covered each week. Submitting questions for 8 of the 11 content weeks will earn you this extra credit point. Additionally, if your question is selected to be on any of the exams, you will earn an additional extra credit point.\nWin Class Catalyst (1 point): Throughout the semester, I will also be observing how you engage with me, the LA, and your peers in and outside of class. Two students who really add to the class dynamic will earn 1 extra credit point each.\n Win Memer of the Semester (1 point) : Each week, you will have the opportunity to submit a meme via Canvas, that reflects your experience with the course content of that week. Memes should be original, i.e., they should be course-specific and something you have created yourself and not simply found on the internet, although you are allowed to use common images/tropes from popular memes as a starting point. All memes will be gathered and sent to the class anonymously at the end of the semester for a survey, and the student(s) with the average highest score and the best scoring meme will both receive 1 additional point. Note: A student can only receive a maximum of 1 point through this mechanism, even if the same student has the highest average score in the context and the best scoring meme."

    "title": "Syllabus: Cognition",
    "section": "Course Policies",
    "text": "Course Policies\n\nAcademic honesty and plagiarism\nWe, as a class, will abide by the Bowdoin College Academic Honor Code. While you are encouraged to discuss ideas and thoughts with your classmates, plagiarism in any form will be subject to grade reductions and disciplinary action. Specifically, you are permitted to make use of online resources and/or search platforms. However, directly copying or adapting written material and/or your classmates’ answers or ideas will be considered plagiarism. This policy applies to both individual and group assignments.\nPlease refer to this page for a list of resources related to plagiarism and other academic integrity issues. Here is another helpful infographic about plagiarism that you are encouraged to go over.\n\n\nUse of generative artificial intelligence tools\nAcknowledgement: This policy about generative AI was generated using the Generative AI Syllabus Statement Tool provided by Seaver College\nGenerative artificial intelligence tools — software that creates new text, images, computer code, audio, video, and other content—have become widely available. Well-known examples include ChatGPT/Bard for text and DALL-E for images. This policy governs all such tools, including those released during our semester together.\nYou may use generative AI tools for work in this course to help with idea generation, literature review, drafting, and other such academic work. If you do use generative AI tools on assignments in this class, you must properly document and credit the tools themselves.\nCite the tool you used, following the pattern for computer software provided by the American Psychological Association (APA) guide. If you choose to use generative AI tools, please remember that they are typically trained on limited datasets that may be out of date. Additionally, generative AI datasets are trained on pre-existing material, including copyrighted material; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in plagiarism or copyright violations. Finally, keep in mind that the goal of generative AI tools is to produce content that seems to have been produced by a human, not to produce accurate or reliable content; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in your submission of inaccurate content. It is your responsibility as a scholar — NOT the tool’s — to assure the quality, integrity, and accuracy of work you submit in any college course. Although you have wide latitude to determine how you use generative AI tools in this course, you must be wary of unintentional plagiarism or fabrication of data. Please act with integrity, for the sake of both your personal character and your academic record.\n\n\nElectronic devices\nMost of our class time will be spent in short lectures and in-person/online activities. Therefore, you are expected to bring your Bowdoin Macbook to class. Please make sure that your device is charged when you arrive to class. In order to minimize distractions, please close or exit out of all other programs except those needed during class, and put your Mac/iPad on “work” mode. All class time should be devoted to working on in-class activities and group work.\n\n\nHow many classes can you miss?\nIt not only benefits your learning, but benefits all of our learning to be present together in the same space. Class time is designed to take advantage of our presence together. To that end, your attendance will count towards your class participation as we will do several in-class activities.\nOf course, emergencies (illness or family emergencies) can and do occur. Note: If you are sick, please stay home. However, I would greatly appreciate that you email me if you will be missing class. If you miss more than 2 classes and I haven’t heard from you, I will be in touch to check in on you. Hopefully you will have connections to other students in the class and can find out what you missed from a classmate. I will also try my best to upload slides and other course materials on the website and/or on Canvas.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nSometimes, life doesn’t go as planned and you have way too much going on to turn things in on time. That is OKAY! This course has the following policies for late work:\n\nEach student has 3 “flex” days that they can use at their discretion throughout the semester for specific assignments (see points 2 and 3). You can use all 3 days at once for a single assignment and turn in one assignment 3 days late (with no questions asked), OR you can spread the love across different assignments.\nFlex days may ONLY be used for weekly assignments (quizzes and/or project work).\nIf an assignment is a GROUP assignment (as will be the case for project work), EACH member of the group will need to count off their individual flex day for the flex day to count.\nFlex days may NOT be used for in-class assessments or activities.\nIf you need to turn in work late and do not have any flex days left, I will consider extensions based on legitimate reasons, which ONLY include verified illnesses and/or family emergencies. In these cases, you are encouraged to reach out to me at least 24 hours in advance of the due date.\n\nUsing ONE flex day means you get a 24-hour extension. Please note that this is a strict extension.\nWork that is handed in late beyond the flex days or without an approved extension will automatically incur a 10% penalty per day, with a lowest possible score of 50% of the original points.\nTo request a flex day, you can leave a comment on your submitted assignment on Canvas. If your work is late and no comment is made on Canvas, the late penalty will be automatically applied.\n\n\n\nInclusion\nI will do my very best to ensure that students from all backgrounds and perspectives receive equitable access and opportunity in this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity students bring to this class is viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. I hope to employ materials and engage in activities and dialogue that are respectful of different aspects of your identity.\n\n\nReligious Holidays\nNo student is required to take an examination or fulfill other scheduled course requirements on recognized religious holidays. Students are expected to declare their intention to observe these holidays at the beginning of the semester.\n\n\nAccommodations\nStudents with documented Bowdoin-granted accommodations have a right to have these met. I encourage you to see me in the first 2 weeks of class to discuss how your accommodations may support your learning process in this course. I highly encourage all students to meet with me in the first few weeks of class to discuss your learning preferences, challenges you may face learning this semester, and how we can create an effective learning experience for you. If you are interested in learning more about accommodations please see Lesley Levy in the Office of Student Accessibility or visit Bowdoin’s website on accessibility-related policies and resources.\n\n\nCounseling Resources\nAs a student, you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduced ability to participate in daily activities. Bowdoin College is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its students. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available. You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus at this link. The Dean of Students Office is also a resource for students facing personal and academic challenges. I encourage you to reach out to the amazing people in the dean’s office for a meeting anytime.\n\n\nLearning Resources\nThe Baldwin Center for Learning and Teaching offers peer-to-peer resources including mentors, Q-Tutors, and Writing Assistants. If you or your family are multilingual, you may also take advantage of Lisa Flanagan to work on writing and speaking assignments and projects. Tina Chong is available as an Academic Coach to work with you on goal setting, managing time, study habits and other strategies to support academic success. You are encouraged to make an appointment and learn more about how the Center can support your learning.\n\n\nOther resources\nIf you are on a budget or would benefit from financial assistance of any kind at any point in the semester, I encourage you to contact your Dean and explore the Supplemental and Emergency Funding website. The Office of the Dean of Students has grant and loan funds available to remove financial barriers so that students can more fully access the Bowdoin experience or to assist students with unexpected financial needs.\n\n\nMandated Reporter\nAs a faculty member, I am considered a Responsible Employee, per the Student Sexual Misconduct and Gender Based Violence Policy. As a Responsible Employee I am required to report disclosures of sexual misconduct, dating violence, stalking, and/or sexual and gender-based harassment to Bowdoin’s Title IX Coordinator, Kate O’Grady. My reporting does NOT mean that any actions will be taken beyond Kate reaching out to you and trying to schedule a time to talk to see what assistance you might need to be successful as a student here at Bowdoin. For more information please check out Bowdoin’s Title IX page."
